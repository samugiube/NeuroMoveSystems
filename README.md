# NeuroMoveSystems
This is a videogame created by three students during work-based learning. The goal was to create a game to help people who suffer from Multiple Sclerosis to do exercise while having fun. The game consist in a skier trying to go through as many gates as possibile. A Microbit is necessary to play this game.

## How to play
You can find the game at https://samugiube.github.io/NeuroMoveSystems, or you can download the whole repository.
If you are playing for the first time, you need to connect the Microbit to your computer with a USB cable. Then, you'll have to download the file microbit-BLEAllInOne.hex. After this, open File Explorer, and drag the file onto your Microbit. If everything worked correctly, another File Explorer window should open, showing the contents of the Microbit.

## Downloading the repository
If you choose to download the repository, you will also have to download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
Once that is done, you will have to get the Live Server Extension. You can do that by clicking the four squares on the left, or Ctrl+Shift+X, and searching for 'Live Server', by Ritwick Dey.
After that, you have to open the folder you saved the game files in. This can be done by clicking File -> Open Folder in the top left, or Ctrl+K and Ctrl+O, and selecting the folder.
Once you're in, you can click on the 'Go Live' button in the bottom right, and a browser window should open with the game in it.

## Playing the game
After pressing the Start button, you'll be able to connect the Microbit to the computer via Bluetooth. This may take a bit the first time, but it should be quicker on the following ones.

After this, you can choose the game mode. You can play with your arms or your body. Whatever your mode is, during the game you have to use your arms/body to move the Microbit. The accelerometer inside of it will be used as a controller to move the skier on screen. Try to reach the highest score!
