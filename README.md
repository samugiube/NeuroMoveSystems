# NeuroMoveSystems
This repository contains all the programs written during PCTO hours, both at school and at home in the afternoon. To play this video game you will need:
1) a Microbit
2) a USB battery or cable to connect to a computer

If you are playing for the first time you need to download the file microbit-BLEAllInOne.hex, and drag it onto the Microbit (from the Resource Explorer).
You can find the game at https://simonefoi.github.io/neuromoveski/, or download the whole repository

After pressing the Start button, you'll get the chance to connect the Microbit to the computer via Bluetooth. The first time may take a bit longer, but the following ones should be quicker.

After this, you can choose the game mode. You can play with your arms or your body. Whatever your mode is, during the game you have to use your arms/body to move the Microbit. The accelerometer inside of it will be used as a controller to move the skier on screen. Try to reach the highest score!
